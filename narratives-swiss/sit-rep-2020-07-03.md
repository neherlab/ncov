# Executive summary

 * SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in late 2019. Epidemiological, diagnostic, and genetic evidence clearly support a single zoonosis (transmission from animals to humans) event in late 2019

 * SARS-CoV-2 had spread globally by mid-February and established outbreaks across the world.

 * Sequences sampled in Switzerland are diverse and representative of European diversity.

 * SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Switzerland many times from many countries.

 * Sparse sampling and limited genetic diversity makes reconstruction of transmission clusters difficult, but with more diversity and denser sampling phylogenetics can complement contact tracing. However, phylogenetics cannot prospectively identify positive cases like contact tracing can.

Following this same logic, there are likely many local transmission chains that we don't yet know about.
<br><br>
This means that even for areas that just implemented social distancing measures, we should still expect case counts to grow over the next few weeks.
These increases do NOT indicate that these measures aren't working. It just takes time for already-infected individuals (and possibly their household members) to manifest symptoms, be treated, and recover. We also expect to see a bump in the number of reported cases as testing becomes more widely available.
<br><br>
It is critical that social distance is maintained during this time. As shown on the right, case counts continue to increase after the intervention is put in place. But, over time, the cumulative number of cases is greatly decreased.

## Social distancing doesn't stop all new cases overnight, but it greatly decreases case counts and fatalities over time
Social distancing -- that is, decreasing the number of people you encounter each day -- can be challenging, but is hugely beneficial to the public good.  
 If everyone decreased their daily contacts by 25%, we would expect to see a 50% decrease in the cumulative number of cases over the next month ([Klein et al., 2020-03-13](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/COVID-public/reports/Working%20paper%20%E2%80%93%20model-based%20estimates%20of%20COVID-19%20burden%20in%20King%20and%20Snohomish%20counties%20through%20April%207.pdf)).

# [Diversity of SARS-CoV-2](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=clade_membership&d=tree,map,frequencies)

 From the initial SARS-CoV-2 clades 19A and 19B, several notable new clades have emerged in 2020. Most clades are present on every continent, but the relative abundance varies from region to region.

 <br>

 Clade 20A and its descendants 20B and 20C have gradually taken over as the pandemic moved from Asia to Europe and the Western and Southern hemisphere. The spread of these clades is more likely due to chance than to intrinsic differences between the viral variants.

# [Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=clade_membership&f_region=Europe&d=tree,map)

 Clade 20A and 20B have dominated Europe since March, while other clades were more common early during the outbreak. Much of the expansion of these clades may be tied to the large North Italian outbreak, as the common ancestor is estimated to have been there. You can read more about the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127738v1) and see a full European Nextstrain build [here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/europe).

 <br>

 Variants 19A and 19B, which are not associated with the North Italian outbreak, continue to circulate in the UK, Spain, and central European countries.

# [SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=clade_membership&f_country=Switzerland&d=tree,map)

 The tree on the left shows individual samples at their collection date. There are samples both from earlier in the epidemic (end of February) and later in the epidemic (mid-May).

<br>

 Consistent with the broader European picture, sequences from Switzerland generally fall into clades 20A, 20B, and 20C. Only a few samples fall into clades 19A and 19B.

 <br>

 There is little difference in the distribution of the clades across Switzerland, with samples from across the country mostly falling into clades 20A and 20B.

# [SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland - Mixing](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=division&d=tree,map,entropy&f_country=Switzerland&f_region=Europe&label=clade:20A&legend=closed)
<!-- having entropy panel on seems to fix map zoom... -->

If we colour the map and tree by the canton where a sample was gathered, and zoom in to the part of the tree where most Swiss cases are found (20A clade, which also contains 20B and 20C), it's clear that cases across Switzerland are generally well-mixed. 

<br>

Though some cases from the same canton cluster together, cases from a particular canton can be found throughout the tree, often near to cases from other cantons.

<br>

Mouse over the circles on the map to highlight the samples from that canton on the tree.

<br>

--------------------

<br>

It's also clear that later samples generally root within the diversity present in Swiss samples from earlier in the epidemic. Given the travel restrictions and border closures, this is not surprising. 

# [SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland - Clustering](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=num_date&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland&label=clade:20A&m=div&legend=open)

 This rendering of the tree shows genetic distances between samples, rather than the temporal distance. You can see the number of mutations (differences) separating the samples along the X-axis.

 <br>

 In the early phase of the European outbreak, diversity was limited and many sequences are identical (i.e. they sit in a vertical line). This low diversity limits the resolution at which transmission clusters can be resolved. Because samples are identical, it is difficult to infer directionality and how they are linked. (Are they the result of transmission of one viral variant in Switzerland, or independant import of two identical variants from elsewhere?)

# [SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland - Putitive Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-06-26?c=gt-nuc_3116&f_country=Switzerland&label=clade:20A&m=div&d=tree,map,entropy)
<!-- having entropy panel on seems to fix map zoom... -->

 The tree is now colored by the nucleotide found at position 3116 - sequences with A are green, and those with G are yellow.

 <br>

 A small subclade has the A3116G mutation (in yellow) and is restricted to the greater ZÃ¼rich area - this might correspond to a local transmission cluster.

 <br>

 With increasing diversity over time, the resolution of genomic epidemiology will increase.
