# Executive summary

In this situation report, we focus on looking at some clusters of Swiss sequences, and what this can (and can't) tell us about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally and within Switzerland.

 * Tentative origin for SARS-CoV-2 variants imported to Switzerland can be considered for a few clusters, but generally the fast growth, limited sampling, and restricted diversity early in the epidemic prevents conclusions being drawn.

 * Later in the epidemic, we find evidence that Switzerland exported some SARS-CoV-2 variants to other countries in Europe.

 * SARS-CoV-2 seems able to mix quickly in Switzerland, with many clusters found in mulptiple cantons.

 * In a few cases, we find evidence of more local spread, with SARS-CoV-2 sequences clustering together by canton

 * Finally, 3 clusters had numerous samples from the end of July, indicating the clusters may still have ongoing transmissions.

<!-- WHAT IS A CLUSTER? -->

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [UK-Latvia-Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/C15720T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&r=country)

What do we mean when we say 'cluster'? Generally, we mean a group of sequences that are closely genetically related. We often put other criteria on them as well - here, we'll be looking at closely related sequences from Switzerland.

In the example on the left, you can see Swiss sequences in yellow. We might call all of them one large cluster, since they are all closely related on the tree, but we might also identify smaller clusters within that larger cluster - like the group of 11 in the middle. 

We can then look at non-Swiss sequences nearby - here we see sequences from England (orange) and Latvia (purple), which seem to be connected to the Swiss sequences.

_You can mouse over a country on the map to more easily identify the sequences on the right._

This tree shows the sequences plotted by the date they were taken, but we can also look at just the genetic differences between sequences (next slide).

_cluster 1_

# [UK-Latvia-Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&m=div&label=mlabel:20B/C15720T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&r=country)

Now we are showing the mutations, or differences, on the x-axis. Sequences which line vertically on a line are identical, and horizontal lines represent differences in the sequences (mutations).

We can now see that the Swiss sequences are 'basal' (at the base) of this cluster, and are also basal to the Latvian and English sequences. This would support the idea that this cluster spread from Switzerland to England and Latvia - but it's important to know we can't rule out other possibilities.

# [UK-Latvia-Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/C15720T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)

By filtering to just look at sequences from Switzerland, coloring by canton, and going back to 'time' view, we can see this viral variant has been found across Switzerland, in 11 cantons.

Though these samples were taken between mid-June and late July, we can see that they are estimated to have an ancestor that existed much earlier - by mousing over the left-most branch, you can see the estimated 'beginning' or ancestor for this cluster is in April. However, the confidence intervals are wide - from March to June. 

Many of the samples are related much more recently, though - they 'coalesce' (two branches join to be one branch) in June and July. This indicates the variant has been spreading more recently. 

Looking between this slide and the previous slide, we can see the group of 11 sequences in the middle, from Basel-Land, are closely related in time and genetically. This may have been an outbreak.

# [UK-Latvia-Swiss Cluster links to Serbia](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/A15972G&m=div&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&r=country)

If we zoom out slightly on this cluster, and go back to coloring by country and displaying the 'mutation' view, we can see it's part of a larger cluster, containing more sequences from Switzerland, Denmark (green), Serbia (blue on left), and Italy (yellow at bottom). 

We can see that the Serbian sequences are basal to the whole larger cluster. This is an example of how genetic sequencing can inform us where clusters in one country may originate: Switzerland seems to have had cases imported from Serbia, and gone on to seed a large transmission cluster in England, and two cases in Latvia.

Separately, Denmark may also have imported the variant circulating in Serbia.

*Can we find links to articles about Serbian imports? Is this cluster likely to be them?*.

---------------------------

We'll use these same techniques to look at other clusters involving Swiss sequences. 

_cluster 1_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Large Cluster in Central Switzerland](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20A/G29543T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

These sequences are part of a larger cluster (shown below) which contains more Swiss sequences, along with sequences from France, Latvia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It's hard to say for sure if the cluster on the left came from the earlier, related Swiss sequences shown below, or was a separate introduction.

Most of the sequences here come from Graubünden, Bern, and Uri. Sequences from each canton tend to cluster together, suggesting the virus spread between these places, then circulated more locally.

All of these sequences are from late June to late July, though the genetic diversity of the virus suggests that this cluster could have been circulating in Switzerland as early as May. However, a number of these samples are from late July, indicating the cluster may still be spreading in Switzerland.

_cluster 2_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# ["July" Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/C9286T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)


This large Swiss cluster is estimated to have been circulating in Switzerland for a few months before the first samples were taken in July. The two samples not shown are from Latvia and Hong Kong and likely were exported from Switzerland.

The diversity of this cluster and the number of cantons involved suggest this variant was well-circulated within Switzerland in late spring & early summer.

As in the previous cluster, many of the samples in this cluster are recent, from late July - a sign this cluster may still be circulating in Switzerland. 

_cluster 3_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Zurich-focused Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/C25731T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

This large Swiss cluster links to two sequences from North Macedonia, with an ancestor to all the sequences estimated to be in April.

It's very important to remember that we cannot say that this cluster originated in North Macedonia. In fact, as international travel was [greatly restricted](https://nezavisen.mk/se-zatvoraat-megjunarodniot-aerodrom-skopje-i-site-kopneni-granichni-premini/) in North Macedonia from early March, it is likely that both the Macedonian sequences and the Swiss sequences came from a third country, which is not in this dataset. 

In a more zoomed-out view (not shown), it is possible to see sequences basal to this entire cluster that come from many countires, including Japan, Switzerland, and Hungary, highlighting the uncertainty of where the cluster originated.

_cluster 4_

_(Notes: when viewing in the Europe build, this cluster is 2 muts away from basal seqs from many countries, including Switzerland)_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Zurich-focused Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/G22205C&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

In the same cluster, we've now zoomed in on just the Swiss sequences, and colored by canton.

The earliest Swiss samples are from mid-June, but the genetic diversity of the cluster suggests it may have been circulating in Switerland as early as May. 

Though the sequences come from six cantons, the majority are from Zurich. The genetic diversity suggests the virus may have circulated mainly in Zurich, then spread from there to other cantons.

_cluster 4_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Large Cluster with many Swiss Sequences](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/C313T&m=div&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)

Both of the previous clusters (the 'July' and 'Zurich-focused' clusters) are part of a larger cluster containing a number of Swiss sequences. Here, the 'Zurich-focused' cluster is at the top, with the 'July' cluster in the middle.

However, we can see a number of closely-related sequences elsewhere in this part of the tree, including a large group at the base of this cluster originating in Basel-Land and Basel-Stadt (yellow and yellow-green to the left - mouse over the cantons on the map to highlight those from each canton). 

As there are many sequences from outside of Switzerland within this large cluster (shown only as grey lines here), it's very hard to determine whether the earlier Swiss sequences were the source of the large, later clusters (and other Swiss sequences in the tree), or whether these were independant introductions from viral variants circulating more widely in Europe and around the world.

_clusters 3 & 4_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Global Cluster containing a Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/C13536T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

In early March, two mutations (4002T & 13536T) arose in Europe and rapidly spead globally. This variant is associated with a large cluster in Switzerland (top, in yellow), but given it was circulating so widely, it's very difficult to say where the variant came to Switzerland from.

The genetic diversity in the Swiss cluster suggests it has been circulating in Switzerland from sometime between mid-March and mid-May, despite the first Swiss samples being from mid-June.

We can zoom in on this Swiss cluster to take a closer look.

_cluster 5_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Global Cluster containing a Swiss Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/G19732T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)

Filtering out two sequences from Italy and Norway (cases posibly exported from Switzerland), we can see this large cluster involves 12 cantons, highlighting how widely circulated it is in Switzerland.

Many of the coalescent events in the tree (where two branches come together to become one branch) occur after June 1st, suggesting that this cluster has more recent growth, after the epidemic peak in Switzerland.

The latest samples are from late July, indicating that this long-lived cluster may still be circulating. 

_cluster 5_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [International Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/G19509A&m=div&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

This collection of sequences illustrates the difficulty in distinguishing Swiss sequences' role in clusters sometimes.

This is a highly diverse cluster, with sequences from all over the world. The tree-building algorithm has separated the Swiss sequences from each other based on dates, but when we look at the mutation view - shown here - we can see that all the Swiss sequences could originate from the sequences at the base of the cluster. Unfortunately, we can't tell whether this is the case, or there were multiple introductions of this global cluster to Switzerland.

_cluster 6_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [International Cluster](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=num_date&label=mlabel:20B/G19509A&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)

We can filter to look just at the Swiss sequences in this cluster.

The earliest of these samples comes from mid March (11th), and the latest from mid July (10th),
and they involve 4 cantons (Zurich, Aargau, Bern, Graubünden), with the earlier sequences coming from Bern & Graubünden, and the later samples from Zurich & Aargau. 

Given the early sample dates of the first samples and the close genetic relationships, it's possible this cluster was introduced early in the epidemic and then circulated around Switzerland.

_cluster 6_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Cluster in Uri](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20A/C2434T&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map)

This cluster of 8 sequences from canton Uri were sampled from late April to early May. They are genetically identical - separated by one mutation from their nearest relative, a sample from Basel-Stadt in mid-March.

However, as usual, we cannot say for sure whether the virus spread from Basel to Uri, or was introduced independantly to each place from somewhere else.

_cluster 7_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Early Swiss Cluster with Germany & Austria](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=division&label=mlabel:20B/G29540T&m=div&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_region=Europe)

These early Swiss sequences from April and May in Zurich, Bern, and Basel-Land are closely linked primarily to sequences from Austria and Germany. 

This may indicate cross-border transmission before borders began closing across Europe in March.

_cluster 8_

<!-- ############ SLIDE BREAK ############# -->
# [Two early clusters](https://nextstrain.org/groups/swiss/ncov/switzerland/2020-08-08?c=country&label=mlabel:20B/C3373A&m=div&p=grid&legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_country=Switzerland)

*Notes: See dated view as well. A little unclear whether 1 or 2 clusters. Range from 28 Feb to 8 Apr.*

_cluster 9_

*Notes: Dates are 26 Apr, 1 May, 8 May - from Thurgau, Zurich, St Gallen. Nearest relative is Thailand from 18 Mar. Hard to say anything.*
