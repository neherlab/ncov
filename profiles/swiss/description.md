This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of hCoV-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) viruses from the ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic with a particular focus on Switzerland.
We aim to include as many genomes from Switzerland as possible.
In addition, we include virus genomes from other European countries and to lesser extent from the rest of the world to provide phylogenetic context.
This context is important to understand how different outbreaks are connected and how the virus might have spread around the globe.
We note, however, that direct linkage on the tree does not necessarily mean there exists a direct epidemiological link.
Sampling of viral genomes is very incomplete and heterogeneous and mutations occur on average only every two weeks.
Extended periods without mutations are therefore not uncommon and direct links or directionality cannot be inferred from the tree alone.

The data from Switzerland was contributed by the following groups:

 * [Computational Evolution group](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo)at D-BSSE of the ETHZ in Basel. Samples were provided by [Viollier AG](www.viollier.ch), sequenced on Illumina technology by the Genomic Facility Basel (lead [C. Beisel](https://bsse.ethz.ch/genomicsbasel)), and processed with the [V-Pipe viral assembly pipeline](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/V-pipe/sars-cov-2/) ([Ivan Topolsky, Pedro Ferreira, Philipp Jablonski, Susana Posada-​Céspedes, Niko Beerenwinkel](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg)).
 * University Hospital Basel
 * CHUG Geneva
 * University Zürich

All data we use (Swiss and international) are deposited in GISAID.
